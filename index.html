          <p> The iPhone is a smartphone made by Apple that combines a computer, iPod, digital camera and cellular phone into one device with a touchscreen interface. The iPhone runs the iOS operating system, and in 2021 when the iPhone 13 was introduced, it offered up to 1 TB of storage and a 12-megapixel camera.
          iPhones are famous for their privacy and security systems. They offer security features like facial or fingerprint authentication to protect your personal information. The iPhone even stops apps from tracking your activity online because of a limited OS and platform.</p>

                    The Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches produced by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking, health-oriented capabilities, and wireless telecommunication, and integrates with iOS and other Apple products and services.
                    Apple initially designed the watch to replace phones and reduce the time users spend looking at phone screens. However, the Apple Watch became popular in part for its innovations in fitness tracking and health monitoring, as well as its ability to be used with internet of things (IoT) devices.
